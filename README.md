### Description

This is is originally from Mark Withers .<br>

I do not want anyone to tell me I steal code.<br>

I just wanted to show Mark how to Update is code...<br>

I got it running under 1 second for a 20 Mb file... yes!!! under 1 second <br>

no, no API required... <br>

only pure VB optimization... <br>

I first calculated all FileLen and Len before the loop... this is THE optimisation that did all the thing <br>

then I used a buffer for looping through the file

and I added null chars at the end of the dll name if it was too short, because in C++, strings ends with null chars <br>

<br>

I hope this helps you Mark <br>

<br>
